            Hiiiiiii, all! My name is Trang Do.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I am an Austin native and I graduated from the
            University of Texas at Austin.  I majored in International Relations
            and Global Studies with specializations in Global Business and Asian
            Studies: Korean. I am Vietnamese-American and a first generation college graduate.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm an artistic person. I enjoy drawing, painting, photography, and video editing. In my free time,
            I also like to read books and check out new music. After a long day of productivity, my
            favorite way to end the day is by winning a couple games of League before bed.

            <br>
            <br> Aside from a nice job, what I look forward to most after this bootcamp is to be able to design super cool websites with ease.
            I love that web design serves as a creative outlet for my artistic passions and I hope to be an amazing web developer one day.
